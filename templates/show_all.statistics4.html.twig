    <h1 class="summary">Conclusions:</h1>
<p class="summary">Based on the data provided, I have drawn the following summary:</p>
<p class="summary">The unemployment rate among the population aged 15-74 in the second quarter of 2020 varied based on gender and age. In general, the unemployment rate was higher for women compared to men.</p>
<p class="summary">Among individuals aged 15-19, the unemployment rate was high for both genders, with a significant increase from 2018 to 2020. In 2020, the unemployment rate for women in this age group was 48.1%, while for men, it was slightly lower at 48.8%.</p>
<p class="summary">For individuals aged 20-24, there was also an upward trend in unemployment rates from 2018 to 2020. In 2020, the unemployment rate for women in this age group was 21.1%, while for men, it was slightly higher at 22.8%.</p>
<p class="summary">The age group 25-34 had relatively lower unemployment rates compared to the younger age groups. In 2020, the unemployment rate for women in this age group was 9.0%, while for men, it was slightly lower at 9.1%.</p>
<p class="summary">Among individuals aged 35-44, 45-54, and 55-64, the unemployment rates were generally lower compared to the younger age groups. However, there was a slight increase in unemployment rates for some age groups from 2018 to 2020.</p>
<p class="summary">It is important to note that these summary are based on data from the Swedish Labor Force Surveys (AKU), which is a sample survey and subject to uncertainty. In cases where the sample size was less than 20 observations per month, the estimates were considered highly uncertain and not reported.</p>
