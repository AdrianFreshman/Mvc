    <h1>Interesting Findings</h1>
<p class="summary">The data provides insights into the number of deaths per 100,000 individuals aged 70 or older who do not have special housing or home care from January 4, 2016, to May 24, 2020. Here are some interesting findings:</p>
<p class="summary">
  The number of deaths per 100,000 individuals shows variations across the years.<br>
  In the initial weeks of each year, the number of deaths tends to be relatively high and then gradually decreases.<br>
  The year 2020 stands out as having relatively lower numbers of deaths compared to the preceding years.<br>
  Weeks with higher mortality rates are observed intermittently throughout the years, indicating periods of increased vulnerability or specific events.<br>
  The dataset does not provide information for week 53, and there is missing data for some weeks in the later years.
</p>
<p class="summary">For more detailed information, please refer to the original data source provided by Statistics Sweden (SCB). The data is sourced from the cause of death register and the register of interventions according to the Social Services Act for the elderly and persons with disabilities, maintained by the National Board of Health and Welfare.</p>
<h1 class="summary">Conclusion</h1>
<p class="summary">From this data, we can make the following summary:</p>
<p class="summary">Individuals in special living facilities experienced higher mortality rates compared to individuals without special living or home care. The average number of deaths per week in the special living group ranged from approximately 730 to 980, while in the non-special living group, it ranged from approximately 100 to 130.</p>
<p class="summary">The mortality rate in special living facilities showed a decreasing trend from 2016 to 2020. Although there were fluctuations between years, the overall trend was a gradual decrease.</p>
<p class="summary">The mortality rate in the non-special living group fluctuated but did not show a clear decreasing or increasing trend over the years.</p>
<p class="summary">It's important to note that the data for week 53 is missing, which limits the analysis for that specific week.</p>
<p class="summary">In summary, based on the provided data, individuals in special living facilities experienced higher mortality rates compared to those without special living or home care. However, further analysis and additional data would be needed to fully understand the factors contributing to these differences and draw more definitive summary.</p>
<p class="summary">The dataset does not provide information for week 53, and there is missing data for some weeks in the later years.</p>
